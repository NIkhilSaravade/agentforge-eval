# 06 — Build log

**Current milestone: complete (M0-M6). Stretch goals not started. Ops layer, results page, release pipeline and prepared production deployment are also done; see the entries at the end and `docs/09-release-pipeline.md`.**

## How to use this file

Add a short entry every working session. Five minutes, no polish. Three lines is
fine.

Why bother: at the end of the project this log becomes the technical write-up,
and the write-up is often what people read before they read any code. It is the
cheapest leverage in the whole project.

Also, when something breaks at M4 that you already solved at M1, this is where
the answer is.

Write down the **wrong** mental model you had, not just the fix. "I assumed
position IDs were per-batch, they are per-row" is worth more later than "fixed
position bug".

Record numbers even when they are unremarkable. A flat number is data.

### 2026-09-19 — M0 — baseline, no cache

**Goal today:** golden fixtures, golden test, naive full-recompute engine, first number.

**What I built:** `scripts/make_fixtures.py` (8 single fixtures + `batches.json`),
`tests/test_golden.py`, `engine/{request,metrics,model_runner,api}.py`,
`scripts/bench_m0.py`. Every decode step re-runs the whole sequence; no cache.

**What broke, and why:** Nothing in the engine; all 8 fixtures matched on the first
run. Batch-independence tests are written but skip until M2 (`generate_batch` does
not exist). Chocolatey could not install `make` without admin, so `make.ps1` mirrors
the Makefile. Run-to-run noise is large: 17.3 tok/s on the first run vs ~13 on the
others, so the 3-run median is the number to trust and the spread must be shown.

**Number:** 13.06 tok/s median (runs 17.31 / 12.91 / 13.06), 5-token prompt,
100 output tokens, batch 1, 4 torch threads, i7-14700K. `results/m0_baseline.json`.

**Next:** M1, own KV cache. Before coding, agree the decode-step position id.

### 2026-09-19 — process note — building M1..M6 in one run

The user asked for the whole project to be completed step by step with every step
documented, overriding the "one milestone per session" habit in PROMPTS.md. The
per-milestone gate is kept: golden tests green, a number in `results/`, a log entry
and a commit at the end of each milestone. Each entry below is written when its
milestone closes.

### 2026-09-19 — M1 — own KV cache, single sequence

**Goal today:** stop recomputing K/V for old tokens, with a cache that is ours.

**Position id, agreed before coding:** prompt length P, decode step N (1-indexed):
the token fed is output token N, which sits at position P+N-1 = `seq_len - 1`
(seq_len counts the prompt plus every output token including that one). It writes
its K/V to cache index P+N-1 and attends to P+N keys. Prefill produces output token 1.

**What I built:** `engine/cache.py` (`ContiguousKVCache`, `[layers, 2, heads,
max_len, head_dim]`), and in `engine/model_runner.py` our own GPT-2 forward pass
(HF supplies weights only) with a prefill path (causal mask, start=0) and a decode
path (one token, explicit position). `generate_cached` drives it.

**What broke, and why:** nothing. All 8 fixtures matched on the first run, including
the 400-token prompt. Decode-step logits are computed for the last token only, so the
LM head is not applied to every prompt token during prefill.

**Number:** 81.41 tok/s median (81.4 / 81.0 / 82.2) vs 13.06 for M0, a 6.2x speedup,
same prompt and output length. `results/m1_kvcache.json`.

**Next:** M2, static batching.

### 2026-09-19 — M2 — static batching

**Goal today:** a batch dimension with padding, masks and per-row positions; measure
slot utilisation.

**What I built:** `SlotPool` and `BatchAccess` in `engine/cache.py` (each request gets a
full 1024-token contiguous slot; a batch reads/writes through an access object),
`SlotManager` in `engine/block_manager.py`, `ModelRunner.step_tokens` (one batched
forward for prefill or decode), `engine/scheduler.py` (static mode: admit only when the
previous batch has fully drained, one padded prefill for the whole batch),
`engine/config.py`, `scripts/workloads.py`, `scripts/bench_offline.py`, and
`tests/test_perf_guard.py`. The batch-independence tests from M0 are now live.

**Design decisions worth recording:**
- Finished rows drop out of the compute; only their *slots* stay idle until the whole
  batch drains. A naive server would keep computing padded finished rows, so this static
  baseline is stronger than the common one and the M3 gain measured against it is
  conservative.
- Tokens are streamed as they are produced even in static mode (most servers return the
  batch at the end), which is also generous to static batching.
- Slot utilisation counts unfinished rows / max_batch, averaged over decode steps only.
- Query t of row i sits at position start_i+t and may attend key j iff j <= start_i+t and
  j < total_i. Single-row cases keep the exact M1 kernels (no mask / is_causal) so
  numerics match the single-sequence path.

**What broke, and why:** the golden and batch-independence tests passed first time
(including a batch of 8 mixed lengths). The performance guard did not: it failed at
~83 tok/s against a recorded 110, twice in a row. Wrong mental model: I assumed
`torch.empty` for the pool was free. It is not: first-touch page faults land inside the
timed region, and whether they happen depended on whether the allocator recycled memory
from earlier engines in the same process. The same configuration ranged 145-205 tok/s
at batch 16 depending on that. Fix: `torch.zeros` for pools, so pages are touched at
startup as a real server would. After the fix, repeated runs agree within 1%. The 205
figure was an artefact and is not reported. Lesson: allocate and touch memory before the
timer starts.

**Number:** static batching, workload B (scaled), 32 requests, closed-loop burst:

| max_batch | tok/s | slot utilisation | attention padding waste |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 57.7 | 1.00 | 0.00 |
| 2 | 65.2 | 0.75 | 0.06 |
| 4 | 85.1 | 0.60 | 0.13 |
| 8 | 119.2 | 0.55 | 0.18 |
| 16 | 145.0 | 0.54 | 0.26 |

Batch 16 is 2.5x the throughput of batch 1, but slot utilisation is only 0.54. That is
above the "well under 50%" the docs predicted: workload B is only moderately variable
(lognormal sigma 0.7). Workload C should be worse; M6 measures it. `results/m2_static.json`.
Prefill was 4.4 s of ~12.6 s at batch 16 with this prompt mix, a larger share than I
expected. Batch 1 here (57.7) is below M1's 81.4 because these prompts are longer (median 64
vs 5) and the time includes prefill.

**Scope note recorded here:** workload lengths are scaled down ~3x from
`docs/04-benchmark-methodology.md` (see `scripts/workloads.py`), decided before measuring,
because full-size runs are too slow on CPU to repeat 3x across every configuration.

**Next:** M3, continuous batching.

### 2026-09-19 — M3 — continuous batching

**Goal today:** admit at every iteration instead of every batch; stream tokens; measure
against M2.

**Where I predicted per-row bugs would appear (before coding):** (1) position ids for a
row that joined late, (2) the key-side mask when rows have different lengths, (3) a slot
reused by a new request still holding the previous occupant's K/V. (3) is safe by
construction: a slot is fully overwritten from position 0 by prefill and the mask hides
everything past `total`. None of the three bit.

**What I built:** continuous mode in `Scheduler._admit` (a slot freed this iteration is
refilled the next; each admitted request gets its own prefill forward, then joins the
decode batch), `EngineLoop` (scheduler on its own thread, requests handed over through a
thread-safe inbox), `NaiveScheduler` (so the HTTP server can also serve the M0 baseline),
`engine/detokenizer.py` (sliding-window incremental decode that holds back incomplete
UTF-8), a streaming NDJSON `POST /generate`, `GET /metrics`, `POST /metrics/reset`, and an
open-loop Poisson harness in `scripts/bench_offline.py`.
Two small additions outside the planned layout: `engine/config.py`, `engine/detokenizer.py`.

**Tests:** every fixture through the continuous engine, the three batch cases, and the
hard one: the `mixed_8` set arriving at iterations `[0,0,3,5,8,13,21,34]` with
`max_batch` 2, 3 and 5, so neighbours join and leave mid-generation. All passed first time,
as did a streamed-text-equals-decoded-tokens test with emoji/CJK and a detokenizer unit test.

**What broke, and why:** nothing in correctness. One trap avoided: continuous mode needs
`max_batch - len(running)` computed *after* retiring, otherwise a just-finished row's slot
is not offered to the queue until the following iteration.

**Number (open-loop Poisson, workload B scaled, 40 requests, max_batch 16, contiguous):**

| rate req/s | mode | tok/s | goodput req/s | p99 TTFT s |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | static | 72.8 | 0.66 | 5.01 |
| 1 | continuous | 80.6 | 1.39 | 0.15 |
| 2 | static | 132.4 | 1.94 | 2.86 |
| 2 | continuous | 147.3 | 2.53 | 0.14 |
| 3 | static | 160.5 | 1.66 | 3.92 |
| 3 | continuous | 199.5 | 3.43 | 0.16 |
| 4 | static | 180.8 | 1.48 | 4.06 |
| 4 | continuous | 235.7 | 4.05 | 0.70 |

Goodput uses SLO p99-style per-request thresholds TTFT <= 2 s and TPOT <= 200 ms, chosen
before measuring. Continuous wins on every row; the biggest gap is TTFT, because a request
no longer waits for a batch to drain.

Slot utilisation only means something when work is always waiting, so it was measured
separately with a saturating burst (96 requests, max_batch 8): **static 0.427, continuous
0.937**, throughput 169.8 vs 231.0 tok/s (+36%). Continuous does not reach 100% because the
tail of the burst drains. In the open-loop rows utilisation is low (0.13-0.50) simply
because 16 slots were never full at these offered loads; that is not a scheduler defect.

**Measured weakness (docs asked for this):** attention padding waste under continuous
batching is **0.39** (39% of attended key width is padding) versus 0.14 for static in the
same burst, because rows are at very different lengths and everything is padded to the
longest. This is the cost of the padded-not-ragged design. Long-prefill stall: a single
800-token prompt injected into steady 2 req/s load raised the worst inter-token gap seen by
other requests from 0.141 s to **0.374 s** (prefill of the 800-token prompt alone takes
`prefill_800_tokens_s` in the JSON). The p99 inter-token gap did NOT rise (0.097 vs 0.073),
so the stall is a single event, visible in the max but not in p99 for one injection. Chunked
prefill is the stretch fix.

`results/m3_continuous.json`.

**Correction to the entry above:** the 800-token prefill measured 0.447 s (`prefill_800_tokens_s`;
it includes building a small slot pool), against a worst inter-token gap of 0.374 s seen by
other requests.

**Next:** M4, paged KV cache.

### 2026-09-19 — M4 — paged KV cache

**Goal today:** allocate KV memory in fixed blocks addressed through a block table, so memory
used tracks tokens generated instead of the maximum.

**What I built:** `PagedPool` / `PagedAccess` in `engine/cache.py` (flat pool
`[num_blocks, heads, block_size, head_dim]` per layer; decode scatters one token per row,
attention gathers the needed blocks into a temporary contiguous buffer, marked
`# LIMITATION:`), `BlockManager` in `engine/block_manager.py` (free list, `can_allocate`,
`allocate`, `append_slot`, `free`), `num_blocks` derived from `kv_budget_mib`, and the
`kv_token_efficiency` and `peak_batch` metrics.

**Design decision (scope-relevant, recorded per CLAUDE.md rule 5):** M4 has no preemption yet,
so it must never over-commit. Admission therefore requires the worst-case block count
(prompt + max_new_tokens) of every running request to fit, while blocks are still allocated
lazily as tokens arrive. This bounds concurrency by worst case, not by actual use; M5 removes
that restriction with optimistic admission plus preemption. It is the reason M4 alone leaves
some concurrency on the table.

**Tests (all first-time green):** every fixture at block sizes 4 and 16; the three batch
cases static and continuous; neighbours joining and leaving with the free list shuffled so a
sequence's blocks are genuinely non-adjacent; allocator unit tests for the block-boundary
off-by-one (prompt of 16 needs 1 block, the token at position 16 needs a second); and a test
that dumps the block table and compares K and V for all 12 layers and 70 positions against a
contiguous prefill, bit for bit. One failure was my own wrong expectation: the newest token
has been emitted but not fed, so it owns no storage until the next step (stored tokens =
seq_len - 1). The fixture set already contained the block-boundary cases from M0, so none had
to be added.

**Measurement problem found and handled:** the identical config (paged, 256 MiB, block 16)
gave 292 and 195 tok/s in two single runs, a 50% swing. Single runs cannot support any
conclusion on this machine. The benchmark was rewritten to repeat every point 3 times,
interleaved rep-major, and report medians with all runs. The third repetition was about 30%
slower for nearly every point (machine drift, not configuration), which interleaving spreads
equally.

**Number** (workload B scaled, 96 requests, closed-loop burst, max_batch 32, median of 3):

| budget MiB | contiguous tok/s | peak batch | paged tok/s | peak batch |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 128 | 72 | 1 | 213 | 13 |
| 256 | 122 | 3 | 240 | 25 |
| 512 | 203 | 7 | 230 | 32 |
| 1024 | 255 | 14 | 234 | 32 |
| 2048 | 291 | 28 | 240 | 32 |

- Memory: KV token efficiency (live tokens / allocated capacity) is **0.94-0.95 paged versus
  0.12-0.17 contiguous**, and paged fits 13x the concurrent sequences at 128 MiB. The memory
  criterion is met clearly.
- Throughput: paged wins **2.9x at 128 MiB and 2.0x at 256 MiB**, roughly ties at 512 MiB,
  and is **slower once memory stops binding**: 234 vs 255 at 1 GiB and 240 vs 291 at 2 GiB
  (about 8-17% lower). That is the price of the gather copy plus the worst-case admission rule,
  and it is published as measured. Paging does not make things faster when there is plenty of
  memory; it makes the same memory go further.
- Block size (256 MiB): efficiency 0.99 / 0.98 / 0.95 / 0.90 / 0.82 for blocks of 4 / 8 / 16 /
  32 / 64 tokens, peak batch 25 / 25 / 25 / 23 / 22. Throughput 241 / 241 / 262 / 246 / 225:
  differences are inside the run-to-run spread except that 64 is worst, so the honest reading
  is "16-32 is a fine default; 64 wastes memory". `results/m4_paged.json`.

**Next:** M5, preemption and admission control.

### 2026-09-19 — M5 — preemption and admission control

**What I built:** optimistic admission (`preemption=True`: admit if the free blocks cover the
prompt plus one block of headroom per running request), preempt-and-recompute
(`Scheduler._ensure_capacity` / `_preempt`: free the victim's blocks, put it back in WAITING
keeping its generated tokens, and on readmission prefill prompt + generated tokens, which yields
the next token directly), eviction policy (most recently admitted among the least-preempted
requests), starvation guard (preempted requests re-enter at the front, worst-treated first, and
are the last to be evicted again), front-door admission control (`max_queue`; HTTP 429 when the
queue is full), and a 413 for requests that could never fit in the whole pool (without that
check such a request would be preempted and readmitted forever).

**Tests:** preemption is forced (asserted `preemptions > 0`, otherwise the test would be
meaningless) with a 40 MiB pool of 4-token blocks and with a 30 MiB pool (106 blocks, just
enough for the longest fixture alone) under overlapping arrivals; outputs after eviction and
recompute are byte-identical to the reference; all 16 requests of a doubled overload set
finish, nobody is evicted more than 40 times, and no block leaks; reserve mode serves the same
overload with zero preemptions; admission control returns False and API returns 413.
My first attempt at the join/leave preemption test never preempted anything because its
staggered arrivals never overlapped enough. The engine was fine; the test premise was wrong.

**Number** (open-loop Poisson, workload B scaled, 60 requests per point, single seed, KV budget
128 MiB, max_batch 32; `results/m5_overload.json`). Columns: goodput req/s / p99 TTFT s.

| offered req/s | M5 paged+preempt+queue cap 32 | M4 paged, worst-case commit | M3 contiguous |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1.08 / 0.20 | 1.08 / 0.19 | 0.44 / 7.22 |
| 2 | 2.04 / 0.11 | 1.84 / 0.68 | 0.10 / 36.7 |
| 4 | 3.50 / 0.14 | 3.44 / 1.05 | 0.12 / 44.5 |
| 6 | 1.03 / 5.40 | 1.28 / 7.55 | 0.09 / 44.7 |
| 8 | 0.83 / 7.15 | 1.89 / 6.11 | 0.09 / 45.4 |
| 12 | 0.98 / 6.84 (7 rejected) | 1.55 / 8.17 | 0.10 / 43.4 |

What this shows, and what it does not:
- **Done criterion met:** past saturation (4 req/s) every system finished all 60 requests, with
  no crash, no OOM and nothing stuck. Latency rises to roughly 5-8 s p99 TTFT and stays there
  instead of growing without bound; throughput stays flat near 200 tok/s. Admission control
  only started refusing at 12 req/s (7 of 60 rejected with a cap of 32).
- **Honest negative:** preemption almost never fired (0-1 events per run). At this scale a
  sequence is ~130 tokens against a 1800-token pool, so optimistic admission rarely runs out of
  blocks. The M5 configuration was therefore NOT better than M4's worst-case admission on
  goodput at overload (0.83 vs 1.89 req/s at 8 req/s) and was better only at 2 req/s. With one
  seed and 60 requests the differences between the two paged systems are within noise, so I
  make no claim that preemption improves throughput here. What it adds is safety: it is what
  makes optimistic admission legal, and the tests prove it produces exact tokens when it does
  fire. Forcing it to fire required deliberately tiny pools in the tests.
- **The real contrast is contiguous versus paged at a tight budget:** 128 MiB holds one
  contiguous slot, so M3 collapses (p99 TTFT 36-45 s from 2 req/s upward) while paged keeps
  serving. This is the M4 effect, not the M5 one.

**Next:** M6, benchmarks and the public page.

### 2026-09-19 — M6 — benchmarks and the public page

**Goal today:** publish honest numbers: Go load generator, one command that reproduces every
figure, charts and a page generated from the raw JSON.

**What I built:** `bench/main.go` + `bench/report.go` (open-loop Poisson arrivals, TTFT measured from
the scheduled arrival so generator lateness cannot hide server latency, per-token timestamps,
warmup discarded, SLO goodput, server-side counters pulled from `/metrics`);
`scripts/run_bench.sh` (starts each server config, drives it, idempotent and resumable, lock file);
`scripts/machine_info.py`; `scripts/bench_data.py` (loads and aggregates over seeds);
`scripts/plot.py` (12 charts, reference palette, fixed colour per system);
`scripts/build_site.py` (single-file `site/index.html`, every number computed from the JSON, the
limitations section extracted from the `# LIMITATION:` comments); `make bench` / `make results`.
171 runs in `results/bench/`, about 2 hours of wall time.

**What broke, and why (three things, all in the harness; none changed the engine's tokens):**
1. *Two benchmark scripts ran at once.* Stopping a background task did not kill the script's child
   processes, so a second copy started while the first was alive. Both used port 8000 and the
   numbers were mixed. Symptoms: garbled interleaved log lines and a result file older than my
   cleanup. I deleted everything, killed every process by Windows PID, and added a lock directory so
   a second copy now refuses to start. Wrong mental model: "stopping the task stops what it started".
2. *Abandoned requests kept running server-side.* When the load generator gave up on unfinished
   requests at the cutoff, the server kept generating them. Overloaded runs left about four
   minutes of backlog that slowed the next run and leaked into its measurement, so a 50 s run took
   nearly 5 minutes of wall time. Fix: cancel a request when its client disconnects
   (`Request.cancelled`, set in the streaming handler's `finally`; the scheduler drops cancelled
   waiting requests and frees cancelled running ones; abandoned work is not counted as served).
   Unit-tested, and checked over real HTTP: after overloading a naive server, a fresh request
   returned immediately. Everything measured before this fix was deleted and re-run.
3. *A background command with a 10-minute timeout.* I started the 2-hour run with a timeout of 10
   minutes; it would have been killed mid-run and orphaned a server on the port. Caught and relaunched.

**Results** (workload B scaled, 3 req/s offered, KV budget 512 MiB, median of 3 seeds, SLO: TTFT
<= 2 s and TPOT <= 200 ms per request):

| config | goodput req/s | p99 TTFT s | slot util | KV token eff. |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M0 naive | 0.07 | 37.6 | - | - |
| M1 KV cache | 0.20 | 26.3 | 1.00 | 0.13 |
| M2 static | 0.80 | 8.9 | 0.17 | 0.16 |
| M3 continuous | 2.83 | 1.64 | 0.29 | 0.13 |
| M4 static + paged | 0.93 | 8.3 | 0.22 | 0.95 |
| M4 continuous + paged | 2.83 | 0.11 | 0.30 | 0.94 |
| M5 + preemption | 2.83 | 0.14 | 0.36 | 0.94 |

- **Continuous batching is the dominant win**: 0.80 -> 2.83 req/s goodput (3.5x) over static, with
  p99 TTFT 8.9 s -> 1.6 s. Workload C (high variance) at 2 req/s: 0.53 -> 1.83.
- **Paging does not change goodput at this offered load** (M3 = M4 full = 2.83); it improves p99
  TTFT (1.64 s -> 0.11 s) and memory efficiency (0.13 -> 0.94). With 2 GiB, where memory does not
  bind, the pair is identical (2.83 / 2.83 goodput, 176 vs 175 tok/s).
- **Paging matters when memory binds or load rises.** KV budget sweep at 3 req/s: at 128 MiB paged
  gives 2.73 req/s goodput against 0.18 for contiguous; at 256 MiB 2.73 vs 1.00; from 512 MiB up
  they tie. Load sweep: at 4 req/s paged 3.70 vs contiguous 2.67, at 8 req/s 1.77 vs 0.83.
  Continuous+paged peaks at 3.70 req/s goodput at 4 req/s offered.
- **Workload A (uniform, the least flattering) shows nothing separating the batching systems at
  3 req/s**: static, continuous and both paged rows all reach 2.97 req/s. Static only loses on
  tail TTFT there (1.49 s vs 0.49 s / 0.09 s). That load is below everyone's capacity, so the table
  cannot show a difference the load never exposes.
- **Naive and M1 are far past capacity at 3 req/s** (0.07 and 0.20 req/s), so those rows show
  saturation, not per-token efficiency.
- Max-batch sweep (8 req/s offered): 87 / 98 / 166 / 244 / 273 / 285 tok/s for 1 / 2 / 4 / 8 / 16 /
  32 rows. Going from 8 to 32 rows adds only 17%: the CPU compute ceiling the brief predicted.
- Block size (256 MiB, 3 req/s): KV efficiency 0.99 / 0.97 / 0.94 / 0.89 / 0.81 for 4 / 8 / 16 /
  32 / 64; throughput is flat (171 tok/s) because this load is below capacity, so the sweep cannot
  rank sizes on speed. The M4 burst benchmark is better evidence: 16-32 is fine, 64 wastes memory.
- Past saturation: p99 TTFT of the full system is 0.21 s up to 4 req/s and 12.3 s at 8 req/s
  (about twice capacity); the queue cap rejects a median 25 requests per run there. Latency does
  degrade sharply; it stays bounded, nothing crashes and nothing is left unfinished.
- Long-prefill stall: the worst inter-token gap seen by ordinary requests was 95 ms without and
  332 ms with one 800-token prompt (median of 3 seeds): one stall, not a distribution shift.

**Deviations from the plan, all stated on the page:** workload lengths scaled down ~3x; 60-90
requests per run rather than a few hundred (3 seeds each; sweeps 2 seeds); one admission-control
queue cap (64) for every variant; the ablation budget (512 MiB) was fixed before measuring and the
budget sweep and 2 GiB rows show the cases where it does not matter.

**Done criteria check:** page built (`make results`) with the headline chart, ablation tables for
all three workloads, block-size sweep, memory-budget sweep, overload chart, methodology and
limitations; `./scripts/run_bench.sh` regenerates every JSON. Not verified: a stranger cloning the
repo on another machine; only this machine was used.

### 2026-09-19 — beyond M6 — operating it: containers, observability, deploy, CI

**Goal:** make the project credible for MLOps / ML-platform roles, which screen for deployment and
operations, not only for scheduler internals. Scope decision (rule 5): this is outside
`docs/02-milestones.md` and was requested explicitly by the user; it adds no engine behaviour and
changes no benchmark number.

**What I built:** `engine/observability.py` (Prometheus counters and latency histograms, plus a
scrape-time collector so queue depth, running batch and KV use are never stale);
`engine/api.py` (`/metrics`, `/ready`, `/health` that fails if the scheduler thread died,
`/version`, `X-Request-ID`, JSON request log lines, warmup before ready; the JSON summary the
benchmark reads moved to `/stats`); `Dockerfile` (non-root, weights baked in, offline, one worker);
`deploy/` (compose stack, Prometheus config and 12 rules, generated Grafana dashboard, Kubernetes
base + monitoring overlays); `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; `docs/07-operations.md` (SLOs, error
budget, capacity plan, autoscaling, rollout/rollback, runbooks, failure modes, security);
`tests/test_ops.py` (14 tests).

**Design choices worth recording:**
- One source of truth: alerts live in `alerts.yml`; the Kubernetes PrometheusRule and the Grafana
  dashboard are generated, and tests fail if they drift.
- Tests cross-check dashboards and alerts against the live `/metrics` output, because the classic
  failure is a dashboard querying a metric that does not exist.
- 429 is treated as deliberate load shedding: excluded from latency SLIs, tracked by its own SLI.
- Scale by replicas, never by uvicorn workers (each would load its own model and KV pool).

**What broke, and why:**
- My first plan had a `draining` flag nothing ever set. Removed it: uvicorn already drains in-flight
  requests on SIGTERM, and the pod's `preStop` sleep handles routing.
- The benchmark looked 4x slower after the change (0.87 vs 3.57 req/s goodput on the same config and
  seed). Wrong conclusion available: "the metrics layer is expensive". I ran the previous commit and
  the new one back to back instead: 0.83 vs 0.90. The machine itself had become about 2x slower than
  during the published session (224.8 tok/s stored vs about 107 tok/s now, both versions). Lesson,
  again: only compare inside one session. Published numbers were left untouched.
- I believed the pod needed ~1.5 GiB for the model and runtime; measured RSS was 1.95 GiB with a 1 GiB
  pool, so about 0.9 GiB. The doc now states the measurement.
- Two shell traps on Windows, not in the project: Git Bash rewrites `/tmp` in `docker run` arguments
  (fixed with `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`), and multiple heredocs in one command are rejected.

**Verified here (Docker Desktop):** the image builds (2.75 GB) and runs with `--read-only`,
`--cap-drop ALL`, non-root, offline, ready in about 6 s, returning the golden tokens;
`promtool check rules` accepts all 12 rules; the compose stack scrapes the server, loads every rule,
provisions the dashboard, and all 19 panel queries return data under real load; no alert fired in a
healthy run. **Not verified:** the manifests on a live cluster, any alert actually firing, the GitHub
Actions workflow (no remote). All listed in `docs/07-operations.md`.

### 2026-09-19 — documentation pass and a check of the tests themselves

**Goal:** bring the docs in line with the code, and test the claim that the golden tests would catch
the bugs they exist for, since they never failed against the engine.

**What I changed:** `CLAUDE.md` (its tech table still said "no Prometheus, no Grafana"; layout and
commands were stale; the ops layer is now recorded as a deliberate, user-requested addition),
`make.ps1` (missing targets), and "as built" or status sections appended to `docs/00` through
`docs/05`, leaving the original plan text untouched so the differences stay visible. README gained a
documentation index.

**The check:** I injected four bugs (decode position off by one, a mask that lets a query see one
position too many, a block allocation one short at a boundary, preemption dropping generated tokens)
and ran the relevant tests. Three were caught immediately. **One was missed**: after a preemption
the final output was still exact, because greedy decoding regenerates the same tokens, but a client
would have received the early tokens twice. My tests compared final outputs only, never the stream.
Wrong mental model: "output equality means the token stream is right". Added
`test_client_sees_each_token_exactly_once_across_preemption`; the injected bug is now caught. The
suite is 102 tests (plus the excluded perf guard). This was a manual spot check of four bugs, not a
mutation-testing suite, and the docs say so.

### 2026-09-19 — results page rebuilt as a designed, animated site

**Goal:** replace the generated report page with a high-end one (React, Tailwind, Motion), built with
design skills and verified in a real browser. Outside the original plan; requested by the user. It
changes no measurement.

**Setting up the design stack, and what I did not do.** The requested commands were checked before
running, because skills are instructions that steer the code I write and installing them downloads
third-party code.
- `skills` (the installer) is the real vercel-labs CLI. `emilkowalski/skills` exists and was installed.
- `pykaku/impeccable` does **not exist**; the real project is `pbakaus/impeccable`, which I assumed was meant.
- `design/taste` does **not exist** and a search found no obvious candidate, so it was not installed.
  I did not guess. If a specific repository was meant, it can be added the same way.
- Installed project-scoped, for Claude Code only, as copies (`.claude/skills`, git-ignored;
  `skills-lock.json` is committed). I read the skills and scanned the bundled scripts: the only network
  references are localhost, for an optional live-editing mode.
- **Impeccable's launcher would download and run a binary from a remote server** on first use, and
  offers a hook that re-runs it after every edit. I did not run it and did not enable hooks: installing
  a skill is not the same as agreeing to execute a downloaded executable. I used the skills as written
  guidance only, which the skill documents as its fallback.
- **Figma MCP was not configured.** It needs the user's Figma account and a token, and there is no Figma
  file for this project. Playwright was installed (Chromium) and used.

**Design decisions from the guidance I read:** one authored motion moment (the headline rising out of a
clip) instead of the same entrance on every section; quiet reveals, ease-out only, UI feedback under
300 ms, press feedback on buttons, nothing scales from zero; no card grids, eyebrow labels, section
numbers, gradient text or hero-metric tiles; a serif display face against Geist, with mono only for
numbers; 6 px radius and hairline rules; one colour per system on every chart; reduced-motion users get
final states. Fonts are self-hosted and inlined, so the whole page is one 797 KB file (409 KB gzipped)
with no network requests.

**Honesty rules baked into the design:** every animation is tagged either Illustration (a simplified
simulation, with its own computed counters) or Measured (drawn from data). Each illustration has the
real measured value it stands in for underneath. The negative results are a full section with the same
weight as the wins, the workload tabs default to the least flattering one (A), and every chart has a
table view, keyboard access and min-to-max whiskers. All numbers come from `site-src/src/data.json`,
which `scripts/build_site.py` writes from the raw run files; even prose such as "8 to 17 percent slower"
is computed (this corrected "8-18%" in older docs, which was my rounding of 17.5).

**The verification loop found real defects** (two batched screenshot rounds, desktop and mobile):
- The headline wrapped to four lines; axis tops sat below the data so whiskers and the 328 ms stall peak
  spilled out of the plot and the peak label collided with the legend; the "Naive" label floated at the
  chart edge although its line stops at 4 req/s; the naive row showed a KV efficiency of 0.00 although it
  has no KV cache (now a dash); two illustration headers overlapped; the batching timeline started
  half-empty; and the illustrations reused the chart's system colours for individual requests, which
  contradicts "colour follows the entity".
- **On mobile the illustrations were clipped at the right edge.** SVGs with a fixed pixel width blew out
  their grid column. **My first overflow test did not catch it**: `overflow-x: hidden` on the body hid
  the overflow the test measured. Wrong mental model: "the test passed, so the layout is fine". I removed
  the hiding and made the test check every element's right edge against the viewport. Lesson: a check
  that cannot fail is not a check.

**Wiring:** `make site` (Python data step, then Vite), `make site-test` (Playwright in desktop and mobile
Chromium: no console errors, no external requests, no element wider than the viewport, headline numbers
present, both illustrations labelled), a CI job for both, and docs updated. `scripts/plot.py` remains as an
optional PNG export into `results/plots`.

### 2026-09-19 — results page v2: TypeScript, a new identity, the full system story, Cloudflare-ready

**Goal:** the first page was a competent report but visually basic, and a recruiter landing on it did not
learn how the system is built, how it is proven, how it is operated, or what went wrong. Rebuild it in
TypeScript with a distinctive identity, a left sidebar instead of a top bar, and the whole story on one
page, production-ready for Cloudflare. Outside the original plan; requested by the user. No measurement
changed.

**What changed:**
- **TypeScript, strict** (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `verbatimModuleSyntax`): the generated data has a
  typed shape (`types.ts`), every component is `.tsx`, and `tsc --noEmit` gates the build.
- **New identity.** Bricolage Grotesque (display), Instrument Sans (text) and JetBrains Mono (numbers), all
  self-hosted; ink-blue surfaces with a single acid-lime signal colour, replacing the serif and amber. The
  chart palette was run through the dataviz validator and needed tuning: my first colours were too light for
  marks on a dark surface, so the series colours were darkened until every check passed (lightness band,
  colour-blind separation, contrast) on both dark and light surfaces. Small text got its own darker steps.
- **Left sidebar** with grouped navigation, scroll-spy with a sliding indicator, a reading-progress bar, a
  theme toggle, and a slide-over drawer on mobile.
- **New sections:** a thirty-second brief; build order M0 to operations; an interactive **system map** (nine
  components, click for decisions, limitation and evidence, or trace one request through it); the request
  **state machine** and the five-step scheduler iteration; an interactive **KV paging diagram** with the
  block-boundary off-by-one; correctness (the golden-test pipeline and the bug-injection results); operations
  (SLOs and a verified / not-verified matrix); and an engineering log of **eleven problems** with the wrong
  assumption behind each.
- **Nothing on the page is unsourced.** Numbers come from `data.json`. The hand-written entries
  (`src/content/*.json`) each quote the repo document they summarise, and `tests/test_site_content.py` fails if
  a quote is missing or if the system diagram names a file that does not exist.
- **Production for Cloudflare:** hashed immutable assets, a Content-Security-Policy with no inline script or
  style and no third-party origin, HSTS and friends, a 404 page, `robots.txt`, social preview image generated
  from the data, `wrangler.jsonc`, and a `deploy-site` workflow that runs only after CI passes and then
  smoke-tests the live headers. `docs/08-deploying-the-site.md` is the runbook. `site/` is no longer committed.

**What the tests caught (each would have shipped):** the browser tests serve the build with the real
`_headers` and run axe in both themes. In order of discovery:
1. *Four accessibility violations:* `aria-expanded` on a table row, `aria-label` on a bare SVG rect, an `<ol>`
   whose children were `<div>` wrappers, and light-theme text below 4.5:1. The last one was instructive: the
   tag colours passed the 3:1 that chart marks need but small text needs 4.5:1.
2. *The HTML document had no cache header.* The rule matched `/index.html` but the page is served at `/`.
   Cloudflare would have cached the HTML and hidden a deploy. Wrong mental model: "one path, one file".
3. *My own preview server ignored the wildcard rules.* The glob-to-regex conversion never handled `*`, so
   `/assets/*` matched nothing and the test would have passed without checking the cache headers. Found only
   because I made the test assert the header. A test double needs its own test.
4. *The page scrolled sideways on desktop* (a decorative grid used negative insets) *and the mobile drawer's
   navigation overlapped its own footer buttons.* Both invisible to the eye at a glance, both caught by the
   overflow and click-interception checks.
5. *A CSS class collision:* `.pt` styled both the SVG pool labels and the problem titles, so titles rendered in
   monospace. Found by looking at the screenshot, not by any test.
Two visual review rounds also fixed clipped chart labels, node subtitles overflowing their boxes, and a packet
marker sitting on top of a label.

**Not done or not verified:** the site has not been deployed to Cloudflare, so the live headers and the deploy
workflow are untested; only Chromium was used; the requested `design/taste` skill still does not exist and was
not installed. Prerendering was not done, so crawlers that do not run JavaScript see only the noscript summary.

write-up.

| Milestone | Closed on | Headline number | Biggest surprise |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0 baseline | 2026-09-19 | 13.06 tok/s (noisy: 12.9-17.3) | first run 33% faster than the rest; warmup alone does not remove variance |

## 2026-09-19: results page deployed

Pushed to github.com/NIkhilSaravade/LLM-serve (MIT) and connected to Cloudflare Pages by Git integration
(build `npm --prefix site-src ci && npm --prefix site-src run build`, output `site`, Node 22 from `.node-version`),
with the custom domain `llm-serve.nikhilsaravade.com`. The Workers workflow was made manual-only.

**What broke:** the first-ever GitHub Actions run failed one job of five: the container smoke test named its
container `s`, which Docker rejects (names need two characters). Renamed; the next run passed all five jobs.

**Verified live:** `curl -I` returns 200 with the CSP, HSTS, nosniff, frame and cache headers from
`public/_headers`; HTML is `max-age=0, must-revalidate`; an unknown path returns 404; `og:image` uses the custom
domain. The Hosting row of the verification matrix is now "verified". Still untested: Firefox and Safari, and the
browser suite against the live URL.

## 2026-09-19: continuous delivery for the engine

Added `release.yml`, `deploy/overlays/ci`, `scripts/rollout_drill.sh` and `scripts/smoke_deploy.py` (see docs/07).
The drill was first run locally on kind (deploy, smoke, bad release contained with capacity never below 2, rollback
restored), then on GitHub: run 35436785477, all three jobs green (publish 2m51s, drill 3m51s, promote 9s).

**What broke:** taking docs/ offline (the user's request) failed CI twice over: `build_site.py` counted docs pages and
`test_ops` read the runbook doc. Fixed by dropping the docs-count row from the page and skipping doc-dependent checks
when docs/ is absent. The executable bit on the drill script had to be set explicitly (`git update-index --chmod=+x`)
because commits from Windows drop it.

## 2026-09-19: performance gate, SLO canary, production prepared

Built `perf_gate.py` (A/B, interleaved, median of 3 pairs), `perf-calibrate.yml`, `deploy/overlays/canary` (Argo
Rollouts + Prometheus + in-cluster load), `canary_drill.sh`, and the not-deployed production path (`deploy/production`,
`provision_vm.sh`, `deploy-production.yml`).

**Numbers:** A/A goodput ratio 0.94 and throughput 0.95 (noise floor about 5%); synthetic 2x CPU slowdown gave 0.30
and 0.33, so the gate at 0.85 separates them. The canary drill promoted the good release and aborted the bad one.

**What broke:** (1) the canary drill's first run failed because Prometheus, the Rollout and the analysis template
landed in the `default` namespace: the base's `namespace:` only covers the base. Fixed in both overlays and guarded by
a test that fails without the fix. (2) The page's data drift check failed in CI because `data.json` carries facts
derived from the repo (test count, lines of code) and I added scripts and tests without regenerating it. It must be
regenerated in the same commit as any change to tests or scripts.

## 2026-09-19: how the final pipeline was calibrated on the runner (summary)

Full record: `docs/09-release-pipeline.md` section 9 and `results/perf_gate/README.md`.

* First full release run (35438689281) was green, but the perf gate had run at the script's default 4 req/s, which is
  far above the GitHub runner's knee (SLO attainment 0.20). It passed only because both sides were identical.
* `perf-calibrate` at 1 req/s showed the opposite problem: attainment 1.00 and throughput equal to the offered load, so
  a slower engine would look identical. At 2 req/s: goodput ratio 0.976, throughput 1.001, attainment 0.95 to 1.00.
  The rate was fixed from A/A runs only. A candidate with 2 CPUs instead of 3 then scored 0.146 and 0.636 and failed.
* Page data drift failed CI twice more (`site-src/src/data.json` carries the test count and line counts, and three new
  verification rows add three parametrized tests). Rule: regenerate it in the same commit as any change to tests,
  scripts or `verification.json`.
* Documentation was taken offline at the owner's request (`docs/` is git-ignored). The README no longer links to it, the
  tests that quote the docs skip when the folder is absent, and the alert `runbook` annotations still name
  `docs/07-operations.md`, which a reader of the public repository cannot open.
* Final state, run 35440722193: ci green; release green (publish, drill, canary, perf, promote).
